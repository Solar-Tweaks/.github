# How do we communicate 💬

We used to have a Discord server, but Moonsworth *(the company behind Lunar Client)* keeps terminating the server. Here on GitHub they shouldn't be able to do so since we are not breaking any ToS anymore and they probably used their relationship with Discord to reach their goal. For example last time we got terminated for "selling, promoting, or distributing cheats, hacks, or cracked accounts", even though these accusations are false and unverified we still got terminated.

Instead we are going to use GitHub discussions, there Moonsworth won't be able to terminate us without a valid reason. You can access the discussion page by clicking on the ***Discussion*** tab on our organization's page. Once there, you'll find a few categories. See news and updates in `📣 Announcements`, chat with everyone in `💬 General` and ask questions in `🙏 Q&A`.

⚠️ **We won't recreate a Discord server. We're going to make videos instead because there, hopefully, Moonsworth won't be able to terminate us without a valid reason. Keep in mind that the GitHub will still be updated! As long as you see the GitHub online, we're here, we won't give up!**
