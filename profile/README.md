# Where is our Discord server?

Our Discord server got terminated again. We got terminated for the following reason `Your account participated in selling, promoting, or distributing cheats, hacks, or cracked accounts.`. We didn't even release the software but we got terminated anyway ðŸ¤·. We are currently dealing with Discord to resolve this issue as fast as possible. We are sorry if it is a bit of a burden for you but we do our best. Don't trash Discord for their decision. The Trust & Safety team is only doing their job and they probably got misinformed.

Here at Solar Tweaks, we edit the Lunar Client source code to enable freelook, remove pinned servers and TONS more!

# What do we have to improve your gaming experience? âœ¨
  * A complete new launcher for Lunar Client with more exiting features
  * Ways to customize the game and unlock features blocked by servers and remove useless features
  * A super cool in game integration for our users
  * A fully open source project
  * A stats proxy for Hypixel
  * And much more coming soon!
